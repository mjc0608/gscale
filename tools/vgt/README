klog
----

klog is the userspace app to collect kernel log generated by klog_printk().

To build it, simply:

# make

To use it, you first need to make sure debugfs is mounted in /sys/kernel/debug:

# mount -t debugfs debugfs /sys/kernel/debug

then run klog to start the kernel log collecting:

# ./klog
# ^C to stop logging

the kernel log will be saved in per-CPU file
./cpu0 ./cup1 ...
