# WARNING: for testing you should not try to use echo something to the screen. For the udev configure you may not even notice any output.
#		   So if you really want to verify if some uevents are received. You should not connt on any output message of your tested program.
#
# This file is used to describe the uevents from vGT driver. And should be placed under /etc/udev/rules.d
# All the *.rules files are scaned on lexical sequence by udev deamon when it boots.
#
# udevinfo seemed like a legacy tool. Not sure if deprecated now. But not available on redhat 6.2.
# If you want to check the info of some sys node, e.g /sys/kernel/vgt
# you can use this command:
#
#	udevadm info --attribute-walk  --path=/sys/kernel/vgt
#
# Also if you just want to monitor the kernel event on realtime, you can use this command:
#
#	udevadm monitor --kernel
#
# When you do not have any idea about how to write udev rules, you can use this way to check if your desired uevents sent out.
#
# Also, please remember run:
#
#	udevadm control --reload-rules
#
# To reload these rules, or you cannot make the udevd apply the updated rules.
