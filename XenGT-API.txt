1 XenGT udev Interface

1.1 Introduction to XenGT udev interface

udev interface in XenGT is used to notify the userland daemon (like udevd)
some events happened. After receiving such events, userland daemon uses defined
rules or methods to take actions. In XenGT, userland daemon "udevd" is used for
this purpose. Event matching and handling in udevd are based on rules
defined in vgt.rules which should be placed under /etc/udev/rules.d.

In vgt.rules, each line defines a matching and handling method of one uevent.
Take a look at the line for handling uevent "VGT_DETECT_PORT_E" (PORT_E 
corresponding monitor hotplug-in.
):

ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="control", ENV{VGT_DETECT_PORT_E}=="1", \
RUN+="/bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/vgt_mgr --detect-display PORT_E'" 

1.2 XenGT udev rules

1.2.1 udev rules for monitor hotplug (in & out)

XenGT uses uevent for monitor hotplug notification. The rules of handling CRT
monitor insertion/removal are exemplified below:"

ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="control", ENV{VGT_DETECT_PORT_E}=="1", \
RUN+="/bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/vgt_mgr --detect-display PORT_E'" 

Dom0 user space can decide its policy while receiving the monitor hotplug 
events from kernel. In this example, "vgt_mgr" is called, and a virtual hotplug 
interrupt will be finally injected into virtual machines. The hotplug injection 
is described in 3.1.5 section.

1.2.2 udev rules for enabling/disabling VGA mode

Another usage for udev in XenGT is to indicate VGA mode changes. The rules for
such uevents are also divided into matching and handling parts. These two
rules are listed below:

ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="control", ENV{VGT_ENABLE_VGA}=="1", \
RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo VM_$env{VMID}_enable_VGA_mode >> /tmp/vgt-log'"
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="control", ENV{VGT_ENABLE_VGA}=="0", \
RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo VM_$env{VMID}_disable_VGA_mode >> /tmp/vgt-log'"

People can change the field "RUN" to enable their own handling methods.

2 Access virtual GFX MMIO space of each VM (Virtual Machine)

XenGT exposes all per VM virtual registers via debugfs:
/sys/kernel/debug/vgt/vmX (here X is the VM ID).

3 XenGT sysfs interface

3.1 XenGT sysfs layout

XenGT sysfs interfaces are located under /sys/kernel/vgt, the sub-directory
"control" contains all the necessary switches for different purposes. After
a VM is created, a new sub-directory "vmX" ("X" is the VM ID) will be
created under /sys/kernel/vgt. This "vmX" includes the VM's
graphics memory information. Detailed information for each entry(a.k.a node)
is listed below.

In below examples all accesses to these interfaces are via bash command 'echo'
or 'cat'. This is a quick and easy way to get/control things. But when these
operations fails, it is impossible to get respective error code by this way.

When accessing sysfs entries, people should use library functions like read()
or write().
On success, the returned value of read() or write() indicates how many bytes
have been transferred.
On error, the returned value is -1 and the global 'errno' will be set
appropriately -- this is the only way to figure out what kind of error occurs.

3.2 sysfs nodes

3.1.1 vgt instance creation
PATH:		/sys/kernel/vgt/control/create_vgt_instance

SYNOPSIS:	echo <vm_id> <low_gm_sz> <high_gm_sz> <fence_sz> <vgt_primary> \
		> /sys/kernel/vgt/control/create_vgt_instance

		echo <vm_id> <low_gm_sz> <high_gm_sz> <fence_sz>	\
		> /sys/kernel/vgt/control/create_vgt_instance

		echo -<vm_id>  >  \
		/sys/kernel/vgt/control/create_vgt_instance

DESCRIPTION:	It is used by QEMU to create a vgt instance when a new VM is
		booting up. QEMU can also destroy a vgt instance by writing a
		negative vm_id.	When QEMU uses this interface, actually it
		uses the write() syscall, instead of "echo".
PARAMETERS:
vm_id		The new VM's ID. A valid value should be greater than 0.
low_gm_sz	The size of CPU visible graphics memory allocated to this VM,
		in MB (The default is 64MB. NOTES: The Windows7 graphics driver
		for HSW requires a minimum value of 128MB)
high_gm_sz	The size of CPU invisible graphics memory allocated to this VM,
                in MB	(The default is 448MB)
fence_sz	The number of fence registers assigned to this VM
		(The default is 4)

RETURNED CODE:	The 'errno' will be set to following values.
		EINVAL:		If the parameters provided can not be applied
				because of illegal combination of these
				parameters.
		0:		Succeed.

EXAMPLES:	Three typical usage for this interface:
		1) Create vgt instance of VM1 with XenGT as the primary
		   VGA card.
		   echo 1 128 384 4 1 >  \
		   /sys/kernel/vgt/control/create_vgt_instance
		2) Create vgt instance of VM1 with XenGT as the secondary
		   VGA card.
		   echo 1 128 384 4 0 >  \
	           /sys/kernel/vgt/control/create_vgt_instance
		3) Destroy vgt instance of VM 1.
		   echo -1 > /sys/kernel/vgt/control/create_vgt_instance

3.1.2 Display ownership switching
PATH:		/sys/kernel/vgt/control/display_owner

SYNOPSIS:	echo <vm_id> > /sys/kernel/vgt/control/display_owner

DESCRIPTION:	It is used to set the current display-owner. The VM which is
		display owner could have the direct access of display related
		MMIOs (not including the display surface and cursor related
		MMIOs). Right now only Dom0 is allowed to be the display owner.

PARAMETERS:
vm_id		The VM ID of a running VM that's associated with a vgt instance

RETURNED CODE:	The 'errno' will be set to following values.
		EINVAL:		If the <vm_id> is not an integer or the <vm_id>
				is the same with current display-owner's
				vm_id.
		ENODEV:		Can not find the proper VM
		EBUSY:		A pending request of display switch has not
				be done yet.
		0:		Succeed.

EXAMPLES:	Set VM 1 as the display owner.
		echo 1 > /sys/kernel/vgt/control/display_owner
		Set VM 0 (i.e., Dom0) as the display owner.
		echo 0 > /sys/kernel/vgt/control/display_owner

3.1.3 Foreground VM switching
PATH:		/sys/kernel/vgt/control/foreground_vm

SYNOPSIS:	echo <vm_id> > /sys/kernel/vgt/control/foreground_vm

DESCRIPTION:	It is used to set the current VM that is visible on display.
		Notice that the foreground_vm does not necessarily equal to
		display_owner. A foreground VM can have direct access of
		display surface and cursor related MMIOs, hence visible on
		display. Other display related MMIOs will be fully virtualized
		if it is not display owner.

PARAMETERS:
vm_id		The VM ID of a running VM that's associated with a vgt instance

RETURNED CODE:	The 'errno' will be set to following values.
		EINVAL:		If the <vm_id> is not an integer or the <vm_id>
				is the same with current display-owner's
				vm_id.
		ENODEV:		Can not find the proper VM
		EBUSY:		A pending request of the switch has not be
				done yet.
		0:		Succeed.

EXAMPLES:	Set VM 1 as the foreground VM.
		echo 1 > /sys/kernel/vgt/control/foreground_vm
		Set VM 0 (i.e., Dom0) as the foreground VM.
		echo 0 > /sys/kernel/vgt/control/foreground_vm

3.1.4 Enable/disable rendering context switch (experimental)
PATH:		/sys/kernel/vgt/control/ctx_switch

SYNOPSIS:	echo <render_switch> > /sys/kernel/vgt/control/ctx_switch

DESCRIPTION:	It is used to enable/disable rendering context switch
		dynamically. This feature was mainly used for debugging instead
		of a formal feature.

RETURNED CODE:	The 'errno' will be set to following values.
		EINVAL:		If <render_switch> is not an integer.
		0:		Succeed.
PARAMETERS:
render_switch	When it is non-zero, rendering context switch will be
		enabled otherwise it will be disabled.

3.1.5 Display PORT/Monitor management

Below are per-VM sysfs interfaces for users to query and change display status. 
Those  interfaces present virtual information which is not necessarily the same
as physical one. Since we do not virtualize display for the VM who is display
owner(usually it is dom0), the information is not meaningful for display owner
VM. Instead, people could use drm interface to get information.

3.1.5.1 monitor edid information

PATH:		/sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/edid

SYNOPSIS:	cat /sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/edid
		echo <binary_stream> > /sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/edid

DESCRIPTION:	It is used to show the EDID of the monitor to be presented on
		that port; or give input to set the EDID. The new written EDID
		value will take effect in next hotplug interrupt.

RETURNS:	binary value of 128-byte EDID block. Extended EDID block is
		not supported.

3.1.5.2 the virtual pipe information

PATH:           	/sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/pipe

SYNOPSIS:	cat /sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/pipe

DESCRIPTION:	It is used to query which virtual pipe is connected to that port.

RETURNS:	value 0/1/2 for PIPE_A/B/C

3.1.5.3 virtual port to physical port mapping

PATH:		/sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/port_override

SYNOPSIS:	cat /sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/port_override
		echo <port_id> > /sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/port_override

DESCRIPTION:	When a VM has virtual monitor presented on this virtual port,
		but physical machine has physical monitor connected to another
		physical port, this interface can be used to tell hypervisor to 
		show the VM's framebuffer on this virtual port to the physical
		port set in "port_override".

PARAMETERS:	<port_id> is 0/1/2/3/4 for PIPE_A/B/C/D/E.

RETURNS:	port id from "cat" command.

3.1.5.4 monitor type information

PATH:           	/sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/type

SYNOPSIS:	cat /sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/type
		echo <type> > /sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/type

PARAMETERS:	<type> is a legacy value, and may change in future. Right now
		it is from 0 to 7 for:
		CRT     -       0
		DP_A    -       1
		DP_B    -       2
		DP_C    -       3
		DP_D    -       4
		HDMI_B  -       5
		HDMI_C  -       6
		HDMI_D  -       7

RETURNS:	type from the "cat" command.

3.1.5.5 monitor hotplug and connection information

PATH:		/sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/connection

SYNOPSIS:	cat /sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/connection
		echo "disconnect" > /sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/connection
		echo "connect" > /sys/kernel/vgt/vm#/PORT_#/connection

DESCRIPTION:	It is used to check current monitor connection status on the
		port, or change the status. If current status is "disconnected" 
		and there is another "connect" command written, the hypervisor 
		will do nothing. 

		If a "connect" command is written, it is required that users have 
		set "edid", "port_override" and "type" in advance correctly. Then 
		a virtual hotplug interrupt will be injected into the virtual machine.
		Otherwise the command will be ignored.

		If a "disconnect" command is written, it is not needed to do any 
		manual changes for "edid" etc. The information will be cleared 
		automatically.

PARAMETERS:	N/A

RETURNS:	The output of "cat" command could be "connected" or "disconnected",
		indicating the monitor connection status.

EXAMPLES:	N/A

3.1.6 Accessing physical MMIO registers
PATH:		/sys/kernel/vgt/control/igd_mmio

DESCRIPTION:	This is used to read/write physical MMIO registers.
		System calls like read()/write() can be used to access
		this interface.

RETURNED CODE:	The 'errno' will be set to following values
		EINVAL:		The parameter passed to read()/write() is
				illegal.
		EIO:		Hypercall can't access the physical register.
		0:		Succeed.

3.1.7 Remaining graphics memory size,the number of fence regs
PATH:		/sys/kernel/vgt/control/available_resources

DESCRIPTION:	This entry shows remaining free CPU visible graphics memory size,
                available CPU invisible graphics memory size and available
		fence registers.It can be used to determine how many VMs with
		VGT instance can still be created.
		The output consists of 3 lines in hexadecimal and looks like this:
		(Using "\" to represent the continuing of the same line)

		0x00000200, 0x00000180, 0x00000600, 0x00000480, 0x00000020, \
		0x0000000c

		00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,\

		00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,\
		00000000,ffffffff,ffffffff,ffffffff,ffffffff,ffffffff,ffffffff,\
		ffffffff,ffffffff,ffffffff,ffffffff,ffffffff,ffffffff,ffffffff,\
		ffffffff,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,\
		00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,ffffffff,\
		ffffffff
                000f

		The first line shows 6 numbers: total CPU visible Graphics memory size,
		free CPU visible graphics memory size, toal CPU invisible graphics memory size,
		free CPU invisible graphics memory size, total number of fence register
		and the number of free fence registers. (Note: the first 4 are in 'MB').
		The second and third line show the bitmap of graphics memory and
		fence register allocation. Bits of "1" mean the resources have
		been taken.

4 XenGT debugfs interface

XenGT debugfs interfaces are used for debugging and
performance tuning. All XenGT debugfs entries are read-only.

DESCRIPTION:	Dumping "access model" of each MMIO registers.
		This includes the "Flags", "Owner" and "Type" fields.
		"Flags" is a DWORD its format like below:
		bit 17 - 31	: Index into another auxiliary table.
		bit 14 - 16	: Reserved.
		bit 13		: This reg is saved/restored at context
				  switch time.
		bit 12		: This reg is virtualized, but accessible
				  by Dom0 at boot time.
		bit 11		: This reg has been accessed by a VM.
		bit 10		: This reg has been tracked by XenGT.
		bit 9		: VM has different settings on this reg.
		bit 8		: Mode ctl reg with high 16 bits as the mask.
		bit 7		: This reg is pure virtualized.
		bit 6		: This reg contains status bit updated
				  from HW.
		bit 5		: This reg contains address requiring fix.
		bit 4		: This is a workaround reg. It means: Allows
				  physical MMIO  access from any VM but w/o
				  save/restore regs  marked with this flag
				  should be treated as unsafe.
		bit 0 - 3	: Owner type of the reg, up to 16 owner type.

		"Owner" is a string name of the owner type but only include 5
		owner name:
		"NONE"		: There is no ownership for this reg.
		"Render"	: This reg is rendering related.
		"Display"	: This reg is display related.
		"PM"		: This reg is power management related.
		"MGMT"		: This reg is management related.

		"Type" is also a string telling main "Flags" of the reg and
		include 4 type:
		"MPT"		: Mediate pass-through
		"Boot"		: This reg is virtualized, but accessible by
				  Dom0 at boot time
		"WA"		: This reg is a workaround reg. Check the above
				  for detailed information.

PATH:		/sys/kernel/debug/vgt/irqinfo

		    616863251092: Last injection
		Total 3 virtual irq injection:
				       3: Primary Plane A flip done

		This interface show 3 kinds of statistics info:
		1) Events timestamp;
		2) CPU cycles used for handling pirq and virq;
		3) Distribution of interrupt numbers;

		These "Events" include:
		"Last pirq":	Physical irq from Gen hardware
		"Last virq":	Virtual irq generated from XenGT.
				The difference between these two
				timestamp is the cost of
				handling physical interrupts.
		"Last virq propagation":
				Set virtual interrupt status when
				the specific bit not masked by IMR.
		"Last blocked virq propagation":
				Set virtual interrupt status when
				the specific bit masked by IMR.
		"Last injection":
				After the hypercall of injecting
				virtual interrupts to some VM.
		When the timestamp is 0, it means such events never
		happened.
